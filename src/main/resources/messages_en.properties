team.title=Mix-IT
team.story1=Mix-IT is a beautiful story began in 2011 and born from the collaboration of the Lyon Java User Group and the Club Agile Rh\u00F4ne-Alpes. 2016 will be the 6th edition already, and one of its first principles "to have an accessible conference to everyone" is always our agenda.

team.story3=Like each year, we are proud to welcome you for some expert sessions, games and meetings. Entrepreneurs, project managers, developers, you will find ideas for your project! Talks are given in French and in English.
